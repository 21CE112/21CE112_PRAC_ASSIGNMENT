/*Aim:Use the Account class created in Programming Exercise 1 to simulate an ATM 
machine. 
 Create 10 accounts in an array with id 0, 1, . . . , 9, and an initial balance of 
$100. 
 The system prompts the user to enter an id. If the id is entered incorrectly, ask 
the user to enter a correct id. 
 Once an id is accepted, the main menu is displayed.
 You can enter choice 1 for viewing the current balance, 2 for withdrawing 
money, 3 for depositing money, and 4 for exiting the main menu. 
 Once the system starts, it will stop by entering number 99.*/
